						<p>
							Climate change leads to an increase in the globe's temperatures. According to the World Meteorological 
							Organization, we have reached 1.1 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.  This 
							poses a risk to us because this increase in temperature has been linked to an 
							increase in the occurrences of droughts. Climate change thus harms us because 
							according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, farms 
							supply around 80% of the world's food. We would lose a lot of our food, and for 
							farmers, they would not be able to make a living.

						<h1>Oceans rise, empires fall.</h1>
						<p>
							With this rise in global temperatures, the ocean becomes warmer as well. The warming ocean's waters are thus expanding, causing a rise in sea levels. Moreover, this rise in temperature also leads to the melting of ice shelves, which act as 
							"walls" that prevent glaciers from flowing into the ocean. The melting of ice 
							shelves have caused glaciers to make their way to the ocean, causing a rise in water levels worldwide. A continuous rise in the ocean's sea level will be dangerous for those living in coastal cities, for it causes damage to these areas' infrastructure and disrupts that area's people's lives. It can also cause disruption of coastal areas' farm land when the saltwater contaminates the soil. This is thus harmful to us because as the sea levels continue to rise, more and more areas will be affected by these floods.

						<h1>Climate Change's Drizzle - A Heavy rain falls</h1>
						<p>
							The rise in global temperatures means that more water is now being evaporated.
							Thus, more water vapor can be used for rain. This has led to an increase in the
							occurrences of rains of greater intensity. We have seen the destruction that such
							storms can bring in the recent Typhoon Odette, which hit the Philippines last
							December 2021. Many lost their lives, their homes, their livelihood, and their
							loved ones. The heavy rain can also destroy crops and cause damage to
							infrastructure. Thus, climate change is very harmful for us.
