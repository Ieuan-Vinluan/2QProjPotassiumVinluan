					<p id="HomeSubtitle">What are the factors that make climate change worse?</p>
					<p id="content1-text1">Many things can worsen the effects of climate change, and we must work to prevent it. For example, the burning or use of fossil fuels has led to an increase in the emissions of carbon dioxide among other greenhouse gases. This has made climate change a hard problem to solve. The industries that heavily use fossil fuels, such as those involving the generation of power, can be a possible suspect.

					<img src="../images/Deforestation.jpg" alt="Trees" title="Trees are very helpful!" class="content1-image3">
					<p id="content1-text2">Deforestation can also make climate change worse. This can be caused by forest fires, where forests are "cut down," or removed, by fires. It can also be caused by the cutting down of trees to make space for construction. 
						Sometimes, even whole forests are cut down for such projects. The loss of trees means that less trees are able to take up CO2, 
						meaning that more CO2 is being released into the atmosphere. This can worsen the effects of climate change and is 
						why we should plant more trees.</p>
